# CRM Sales Pipeline Analysis

## Story
This project analyzes the company’s CRM and sales pipeline data to understand how leads move through different stages and how they are converted into successful deals. By examining information about organisations, industries, products, sales owners, and deal values, the project aims to reveal patterns and insights that can help improve sales performance and revenue generation.

## Problem Statement
The company generates many leads from different countries and industries, but only a small portion of these leads turn into successful deals. Management lacks clear insights into which factors affect deal success, where leads are most likely to drop off in the sales pipeline, and which products or regions contribute the most to revenue. This creates uncertainty in planning and limits potential growth.

## Business Questions
- Which stage of the sales pipeline has the highest lead drop-off?
- Which countries and industries generate the most successful deals?
- Which products bring the highest deal value?
- Which sales owners have the best performance in closing deals?
- What is the average time taken to close a deal from lead acquisition to actual close date?
